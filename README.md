# FreMFp
Machine learning with frequency molecular fingerprint (FreMFp) for OSCs donor materials
 Based on the design process of polymer donor materials, we proposed the frequency molecular fingerprint (FreMFp), which follows three steps: "decoupling of key substructures, quantitative statistics of frequencies, classification of functional units".
 The main tasks in this project include:
1.Model selection based on 10-fold stratified CV among RF, GB, XGB, SVM and MLP
2.Feature engineering based on mRMR, hyper-parameter optimization based on grid-search
3.Model evaluation based on 10-fold, 5-fold stratified CV and test set
4.Model interpretation based on SHAP
5.Feature generalizability evaluation based on stratified CV of three dye classes
6.Model application in external dataset and 27 novel yellow dyes
